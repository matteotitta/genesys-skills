# Competitor Data Schema — Reference Guide

A centralized data architecture for managing competitor information across comparison pages, battlecards, and analysis. This schema ensures consistency and enables efficient page generation at scale.

---

## Why a Centralized Schema?

### Problems with ad-hoc competitor data:
- Inconsistent information across pages
- Outdated pricing in some places
- Duplicate research effort
- Hard to update when competitors change

### Benefits of centralized schema:
- **Single source of truth** — Update once, reflect everywhere
- **Scalable page generation** — Template + data = pages
- **Consistency** — Same facts across all content
- **Maintenance efficiency** — Track what needs updating

  competitor_id: string

  # Feature comparison matrix
  features:
    - category: string
      features:
        - name: string
          your_product: string    # ✓, ✗, "Partial", "Add-on"
          competitor: string
          your_detail: string
          competitor_detail: string
          winner: string          # you, them, tie

  # Head-to-head summary
  versus:
    your_product_better_when: array
    competitor_better_when: array
    pricing_comparison: string
    migration_difficulty: string  # Easy, Medium, Hard

  # Page content
  content:
    hero_headline: string
    meta_title: string
    meta_description: string
    tldr_summary: string
    faq:
      - question: string

## Alternative Page Schema

For generating alternative pages:

```yaml
alternative_page:
  competitor_id: string
  page_type: string             # singular, plural

  # Pain points (why people leave competitor)
  switch_reasons:
    - pain_point: string
      detail: string
      source: string            # G2, interview, etc.

## Data Source Tracking

Every data point should track its source:

```yaml
data_point:
  value: any
  source: string              # URL or source name
  source_type: string         # Primary, Secondary, Inferred
  confidence: string          # High, Medium, Low
  verified_date: date
  expires: date               # When to re-verify
```

**Confidence levels:**
| Level | Definition | Example Sources |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| High | Official/primary source | Pricing page, press release |
| Medium | Reliable secondary | G2, analyst report |
| Low | Inferred or dated | Old article, forum post |

## Usage Patterns

### Generating a Comparison Page

```python
# Pseudocode
def generate_comparison_page(your_product, competitor_id):
    competitor = load_competitor(competitor_id)
    comparison = load_comparison_data(competitor_id)
    template = load_template("you-vs-competitor")

    return render(template, {
        "competitor": competitor,
        "comparison": comparison,
        "your_product": your_product
    })
```

### Generating Alternative Pages

```python
def generate_alternatives_page(competitor_id, page_type):
    competitor = load_competitor(competitor_id)
    alt_data = load_alternative_data(competitor_id)
    template = load_template(f"{page_type}-alternative")

    return render(template, {
        "competitor": competitor,
        "alternative": alt_data
    })
```

### Bulk Updates

```python
def update_all_pricing():
    for competitor in load_all_competitors():
        if competitor.pricing.last_verified < 30_days_ago:
            new_pricing = fetch_pricing(competitor.website)
            competitor.pricing = new_pricing
            competitor.pricing.last_verified = today()
            save_competitor(competitor)
```

## Maintenance Workflows

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Check for pricing page changes on priority competitors
- [ ] Update review counts if significantly changed
- [ ] Log any competitor announcements

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Verify top 10 competitor pricing data
- [ ] Update review sentiment themes
- [ ] Add any new competitors to track
- [ ] Review data quality flags

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Full audit of all competitor data
- [ ] Update feature comparisons
- [ ] Refresh screenshots
- [ ] Review and update competitive intelligence

---

## Data Quality Rules

### Required Fields (Must Have)
- id, name, website
- pricing.tiers (at least one)
- product.description
- reviews (at least G2 or Capterra)

### Recommended Fields (Should Have)
- company.employee_count
- pricing.last_verified
- competitive.strengths and weaknesses
- icp.company_sizes

### Nice to Have
- company.revenue_estimate
- named_customers
- marketing.content_frequency

### Validation Rules
1. `pricing.last_verified` must be within 30 days
2. `reviews.last_updated` must be within 90 days
3. All URLs must be valid
4. `data_quality` must reflect actual completeness
