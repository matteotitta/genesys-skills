# Content strategy

Synthesise foundational research (ICP, messaging, competitors, TOV, brand) into an actionable B2B SaaS content plan: service-based pillars, TOFU/MOFU/BOFU funnel mapping, channel mix, cadence, and a 90-day execution roadmap. Volume targets, recurring series, and a sample week make the strategy executable from day one.

## When to run

Invoke when the user asks for:
- "Create a content strategy / content plan / content marketing strategy for [company]"
- "Content calendar for [company]" or "build a content program"
- "What content should [company] create?" / "content roadmap"
- Channel-specific strategies: "social media strategy", "LinkedIn content strategy", "podcast/YouTube strategy", "newsletter strategy"

Do NOT invoke when:
- User wants individual posts only → `linkedin-content` or `youtube-scripts`
- User wants messaging framework → `product-messaging`
- User wants ICP research only → `icp-behavioural`
- User wants product launch plan → `product-launch`
- User wants SEO/AEO research and article queue → chain `aeo-strategy` after this skill

## Inputs

This skill accepts any context dimension. The more available, the stronger the strategy. It synthesises whatever foundations exist.

### Context dimensions

| Input | Source | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **ICP research** — segments, personas, pain points | `icp-behavioural` | High — drives pillar relevance + funnel mapping |
| **Product messaging** — positioning, capabilities, differentiators | `product-messaging` | High — drives pillar selection + content angles |
| **Competitor research** — content analysis, gaps | `competitor-research` | Medium — drives differentiation + gap-filling |
| **TOV guidelines** — voice, vocabulary, patterns | `tov-guidelines` | Medium — drives style + consistency |
| **Company context** — overview, market position, leadership | `company-context` | Medium — drives narrative + brand pillars |
| **Brand identity** — visual guidelines, mood | `brand-kit` | Low-Medium — drives visual content specs |
| **Content audit** — existing inventory + performance | `content-audit` | Medium — drives gap analysis + build-on |
| **Market research** — industry trends, TAM/SAM | User or research skills | Low-Medium — drives trend angles |

### Minimum viable input

At least one of: ICP research • product messaging • company context.

### Validation checklist

- [ ] At least one context dimension available
- [ ] Company name and context clear
- [ ] Enough foundation to define service-based pillars (not generic ones)

If inputs are thin: flag missing dimensions and their impact, offer to chain `icp-behavioural` → `product-messaging` → `tov-guidelines` → `competitor-research`. Proceed with what's available, but mark assumptions.

## Steps

The skill executes 6 phases. Detailed sub-steps + checkpoints in the premium reference. Visual flowchart in the premium reference. Frameworks (service-based pillars, TOFU/MOFU/BOFU, pillar × funnel matrix, content flow, channel hierarchy, content cascade) in the premium reference. Pillar-design depth in the premium reference. Channel-specific guidance in the premium reference. Narrative architecture mental models in the premium reference.

1. **Validate inputs.** Check minimum viable input present. If thin, chain prerequisite skills or proceed with assumptions explicitly flagged.
2. **Phase 1 — Foundations.** Define 2-4 prioritised content goals (revenue / awareness / employer brand / customer success), 4-6 core topics from ICP+messaging, 3-5 differentiators, audience segment matrix.
3. **Phase 2 — Pillars + funnel.** Define 4-5 service-based pillars (30/25/20/15/10% mix) — NOT generic Educational/Personal/Promotional. AI/automation is the throughline across all pillars. Map TOFU 40% / MOFU 35% / BOFU 25%. Build the pillar × funnel matrix with named example content per cell. Calculate mix in both dimensions with monthly counts.
4. **Phase 3 — Channels.** Tier 1 (always): LinkedIn + Blog/Newsletter. Tier 2 (if capacity): Podcast/YouTube as anchor. Tier 3 (contextual): X.com, events, IG/TikTok. Pick anchor content (highest-effort, highest-value) and design the cascade (anchor → 5-10 derivatives). Document channel specs: format, frequency, primary pillar, metrics, tooling.
5. **Phase 4 — Planning + execution.** Calculate volume targets (total + per-channel + per-pillar). Define weekly cadence (production vs publishing). Design 90 days: Month 1 Launch & Foundation → Month 2 Education & Nurturing → Month 3 Proof & Conversion. List recurring series (weekly/monthly/quarterly). Build sample example week.
6. **Phase 5 — Metrics + governance.** Define metrics by channel (primary + secondary + targets). Document approval workflow + quality checklist + archive/refresh policy. Inventory gaps + assumptions + follow-up research.
7. **Phase 6 (optional) — Operationalisation bridge.** When 2+ team members, 8+ pieces/month, multiple active channels, or series-based content planned, chain into `content-operations` for series architecture, cross-channel sequencing, production pipeline, channel optimisation.
8. **Self-evaluation.** Verify: topics derived from inputs (not invented), pillars are service-based, mixes sum to 100% on both dimensions, volume realistic for capacity. Apply the anti-hallucination guardrails in the premium reference.
9. **Assemble output.** Use the standard structure in the premium reference: 1. Strategy foundations → 2. Pillars + funnel → 3. Channel strategy → 4. Planning + execution → 5. Metrics + governance → 6. Gaps + recommendations.
10. **Pre-delivery quality gate.** Run the four-block checklist (strategy / pillars+funnel / channel / execution) in the premium reference. If any check fails, fix or explicitly flag.
11. **Review gate (Level 2 — Spot Check).** Present foundations, pillars, channels, 90-day plan, volume targets. Actions: [Approve] [Adjust mix] [Refine].
12. **Iteration prompts.** Offer refinement / expansion / quality prompts (full menu in the premium reference).

## What good looks like

### Evaluations

Strategy quality:
- [ ] Goals are measurable and prioritised
- [ ] Core topics trace back to ICP/messaging (no inventions)
- [ ] Differentiators are specific and defensible
- [ ] Audience segments align with ICP

Pillars + funnel:
- [ ] Pillars are service-based (not Educational/Personal/Promotional)
- [ ] AI/automation is throughline, not a separate pillar
- [ ] TOFU/MOFU/BOFU mapped with content types
- [ ] Pillar × funnel matrix populated with named examples
- [ ] Mix percentages sum to 100% on both dimensions
- [ ] Monthly counts calculated for both dimensions
- [ ] Formats are specific with funnel stage assignment

Channel:
- [ ] LinkedIn + Blog/Newsletter included
- [ ] Bonus channels justified with rationale
- [ ] Anchor content defined with cascade
- [ ] Metrics defined per channel

Execution:
- [ ] Volume realistic for team capacity
- [ ] Weekly cadence is actionable
- [ ] 90-day themes build logically (Launch → Educate → Prove)
- [ ] Recurring series are repeatable

## Final ship gate

Run `/premortem --output` before ship. See [`/premortem` skill](../../../../meta/orchestration/premortem/SKILL.md) for the 5 execution domains (will-it-resonate / will-it-convert / will-it-stay-on-brand / will-stakeholder-push-back / will-it-degrade-over-time) and output template.

Trivial-case escape: `## Premortem\nNo failure modes — trivial change` satisfies the contract for genuinely trivial outputs.
