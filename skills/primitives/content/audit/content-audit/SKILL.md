# Content audit

Run a comprehensive content marketing audit for a B2B SaaS company across newsletter/blog, LinkedIn, YouTube, and events. Produces a content inventory, per-channel scores, pillar-mix analysis, gap analysis, success patterns, and prioritized recommendations. Diagnostic only — feeds into `/content-strategy`. Knowledge type: `content-audit` (per `.claude/rules/ontology.md`).

## Research substrate

Default substrate: **Exa** per `.claude/rules/exa-protocol.md` (auto-loaded). Primary tools: `crawling_exa` (site content inventory), `web_search_exa` (competitor benchmarks, channel discovery). Fall back to Firecrawl if `crawling_exa` unavailable. **Crawl-cost discipline** (`.claude/rules/crawl-cost-discipline.md`): for the site content inventory, enumerate pages first with free `mcp__spider__spider_links` (local, no credits), triage to the in-scope set, then spend `crawling_exa` / Firecrawl only on kept pages — don't crawl the whole domain just to inventory it. Migration window: prefer `mcp__plugin_exa_exa__*` once installed; legacy `mcp__exa__*` still mounted as fallback. Citation: `[VERIFIED: exa_search, {url}, accessed {YYYY-MM-DD}]`. Quality gate: ≥3 sources per major claim, ≥50% `[VERIFIED]`, no `WebSearch` fallback without flagging the gap.

## When to run

Invoke when the user asks for: `audit [company]'s content`, `content audit for [company]`, `analyze [company]'s content marketing`, `review [company]'s content channels`, `what content is [company] producing?`, `content performance analysis for [company]`, `audit their newsletter/blog/YouTube/LinkedIn`, `content marketing assessment`. Do **NOT** invoke for: individual post creation (use `/linkedin-content` or `/youtube-scripts`), strategy build (use `/content-strategy` — this skill feeds it), competitor content scan (use `/competitor-research` Dimension 6), TOV-only analysis (use `/tov-guidelines`), single-channel quick reviews (answer directly).

Two run modes:

Visual phase map → the premium reference.

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `company name` — exact company/product name.
- `website URL` — main site, accessible.

**Recommended (improve quality):**

- `newsletter URL` — Substack, Beehiiv, ConvertKit, Ghost, or blog RSS.
- `LinkedIn page or founder profile` — primary B2B social channel.
- `YouTube channel URL` — for video content assessment.
- `Luma/Eventbrite page` — for events content assessment.

**Optional:** API access (YouTube, LinkedIn), time range (default: last 6 months), specific questions, current content team size, content goals.

**Validation:** company name unambiguous, website accessible, at least one content channel URL confirmed, time range established. If channels missing, ask for at least newsletter OR LinkedIn URL — offer to search for others.

## Steps

1. **Discover content channels and confirm scope** → the premium reference (Phase 1). Fetch footer/nav, run `site:[domain] blog OR newsletter OR resources` and `site:linkedin.com / youtube.com / lu.ma / eventbrite.com` searches. Verify access, note rate limits, prioritize by activity, lock time range.
2. **Audit newsletter/blog** → the premium reference (Phase 2). Fetch archive, sample 10–15 recent posts, calculate cadence, categorize topics by pillar, assess formats and quality signals (headlines, CTAs, lead magnets, depth). Per-channel scraping methods → the premium reference.
3. **Audit LinkedIn** → the premium reference (Phase 3). Pull last 20–30 posts, calculate cadence, categorize formats (text/carousel/video/image/poll/article), map topics, assess engagement, sample 5–10 posts for voice and hook patterns.
4. **Audit YouTube (if applicable)** → the premium reference (Phase 4). Pull channel data (subs, video count), calculate cadence, categorize content types, note view counts on recent videos, sample 2–3 videos for production quality (audio, visuals, editing, branding, thumbnails).
5. **Audit events (if applicable)** → the premium reference (Phase 5). Pull events from Luma/Eventbrite/LinkedIn Events, calculate cadence, categorize types (webinar/workshop/meetup/conference), note virtual vs. in-person mix, assess community signals (attendance, speakers, recordings).
6. **Cross-channel synthesis** → the premium reference (Phase 6). Calculate total monthly volume, aggregate pillar mix vs. 40/25/25/10 target, identify gaps, assess voice/topic/brand consistency, surface success patterns, generate recommendations (quick wins, strategic, long-term), assign 1–5 scores per dimension.
7. **Apply scoring rubric** → the premium reference for detailed per-dimension rubrics; the premium reference for the 4-pillar definitions, 7-dimension audit table, 1–5 scale, and B2B benchmarks (newsletter, LinkedIn, YouTube, events).
8. **Pre-production validator path (only if `mode=pre_production`)** — apply the 10-signal BOFU rubric in the premium reference instead of Phases 2–6. Returns PASS/REVISE/REJECT verdict.
9. **Write output** per the premium reference (full structure: header, exec summary, scorecard, channel inventory, per-channel sections, cross-channel analysis, gap analysis, success patterns, recommendations, content-strategy input summary, data gaps, iteration prompts).
10. **Self-evaluate against quality gates** → the premium reference. Run anti-hallucination guardrails (6 rules), data-quality / analysis-quality / handoff-quality / format-quality checklists, anti-example check.
11. **Push** to Google Docs per the export destination in `Push` below. Run review gate Level 2 (spot check) — present executive summary, scorecard, channel audits, recommendations.
12. **Offer iteration prompts** → the premium reference (refinement, expansion, quality prompts; feedback signal table; reference-example capture protocol).

## What good looks like

### Evaluations (binary pass/fail before declaring "done")

- All discovered channels documented with URL + active/inactive status + last-active date.
- Specific numbers everywhere (no "they post regularly" — instead "3.2 posts/month, every Tuesday").
- Sources linked for every key finding (specific posts, pages, content pieces).
- No invented metrics, engagement guesses, or assumed strategy intent.
- Pillar mix percentages calculated per channel and aggregate; compared to 40/25/25/10 target with gap shown.
- 1–5 scores assigned across volume, consistency, quality, pillar balance, cross-channel alignment, plus overall health.
- Recommendations split into quick wins (this week), strategic (30 days), long-term (next quarter).
- Content-strategy input summary completed (current baseline, key inputs, recommended focus).
- Voice patterns summarized for downstream `/tov-guidelines` handoff.
- Data gaps surfaced explicitly with workaround — no silent omissions.
- Output title is `# Content Audit: [Company Name]` exactly. Header includes website, audit period, prepared-by, channels audited, audit date.

## Integration with other skills

| Direction | Skill | What flows |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Feeds into** | `/content-strategy` | Baseline volume, pillar mix, gaps, voice patterns, successful formats → strategy creation foundation |
| **Feeds into** | `/tov-guidelines` | Voice patterns from LinkedIn voice analysis → TOV input |
| **Feeds into** | `/linkedin-content` | LinkedIn audit findings → post creation calibration |
| **Feeds into** | `/youtube-scripts` | YouTube audit findings → video strategy |
| **Related** | `/competitor-research` | Dimension 6 (Content) is a subset — use `/competitor-research` for comparative content scan across competitors |

**Recommended chains:**

- Build content engine: `content-audit → content-strategy → linkedin-content / aeo-content / youtube-scripts`.
- Voice extraction: `content-audit → tov-guidelines`.
- Competitive content benchmark: `content-audit (client) + competitor-research (Dimension 6, top 3 competitors) → content-strategy`.
