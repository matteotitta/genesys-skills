# ICP research skill

Generate ideal customer profiles for B2B SaaS clients through systematic research and structured output.

## Report structure

The final ICP report follows this numbered section order:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Header | Research date, website, category, confidence score (1-5) |
| 1. Executive summary | High-level synthesis of findings and strategic recommendations |
| 2. TAM analysis | Market sizing with targeting strategy per layer (TAM/SAM/SOM/ICP) |
| 3. Firmographics analysis | Geographic, industry, company segment patterns, and technographics |
| 4. Roles and personas | Core use case, Champion deep-dive, Economic Buyer deep-dive, buying journey |
| 5. Negative ICP | Who is NOT a fit, disqualification criteria, and red flags |
| 6. Customer proof points | Named customers, outcomes, and evidence with URLs |
| 7. Voice of customer synthesis | Language patterns, pain points, and outcome terminology |
| 8. ICP segment definitions | Scoring matrix, in-market signals, segment deep-dives |
| 9. Intent signals and buying triggers | Observable signals indicating purchase readiness |
| 10. Recommendations | Prioritization and messaging by segment |
| 11. Data gaps | Missing information and follow-up suggestions |
| 12. Source appendix | All sources with access dates, URLs, and confidence levels |

**Confidence score calculation:** Count High/Medium/Low data points. Score 5 if >70% High, Score 4 if >50% High, Score 3 if mixed, Score 2 if >50% Low, Score 1 if >70% Low.

## Output dimensions

Research produces structured outputs across these dimensions. **Full field schemas + table structures + persona deep-dive templates: `references/dimensions.md`.**

| Dimension | What it covers |
|-----------|----------------|
| **TAM analysis** | TAM/SAM/SOM/ICP table with targeting strategy per layer + assumptions |
| **Firmographics** | Geography, industry, company segments + segment deep-dives + technographics + adjacent stack |
| **Technographics** | Required vs preferred tools by category (CRM, CDP, Analytics, etc.) with evidence |
| **Personas** | Champion (12 fields) + Economic Buyer (13 fields) + Users + buying journey + core use case |
| **Negative ICP** | Disqualification criteria + red flags from churn + objections that signal poor fit |
| **Customer proof points** | Named customers + outcome patterns with URL + date |
| **Voice of customer** | Terminology / pain / outcome / objection patterns with verbatim quotes |
| **Segments** | Scoring matrix (TAM × Ease of win × Strategic fit) + per-segment deep-dive + positioning |
| **Beachhead selection** (optional) | Pick ONE segment to dominate first using weighted scoring rubric |
| **Intent signals** | Company-level + persona-level signals with detection sources |

Each persona deep-dive includes a verbatim Channels & Influences map (communities, content, events, influencers) and a sourced testimonial. Each segment deep-dive includes Priorities, ICP-fit, Budget & sales cycle, Unique approach, and Proof points.

## Sorting rules

Apply consistently across all tables:

| Dimension | Sort order |
|-----------|------------|
| Decision role | **Champion → Economic Buyer → User → Influencer** |
| Company size | Enterprise → Mid-market → SMB → Startup |
| Frequency | Very high → High → Medium → Low |
| Confidence | High → Medium → Low |
| Customer concentration | High → Medium → Low |
| Priority | 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 |
| Industry presence | Strong → Moderate → Emerging |

---

## Workflow

The research runs in 3 phases. Read `references/workflow.md` for the full step-by-step.

Phase summary:

1. **Data extraction** — discover key pages (customers, case studies, solutions, pricing, integrations, G2, LinkedIn) → extract raw data with URL+date per source → normalize attributes (geography, industry, company size, team size, tech stack)
2. **Analysis and synthesis** — identify patterns per segment → build Champion + Economic Buyer deep-dives → identify negative ICP + intent signals → collect proof points → document technographics → calculate TAM with targeting strategy → identify ICP as highest-priority segment below SOM
3. **Structured output** — generate the 12 numbered sections, apply sorting rules, include rich descriptions with URLs and dates

## Input requirements

### Required
- **Website URL** — primary company website

### Optional (improves quality)

| Input | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Case studies URL | Direct link to case studies page |
| Testimonials URL | Direct link to testimonials |
| Market context | Category, competitors, GTM approach |
| Sales call notes | Win/loss context, objections |
| Existing ICP docs | Validate or expand current understanding |

---

## Anti-hallucination guardrails

1. **Never invent customer names.** Only cite publicly referenced customers.
2. **Quote verbatim.** Use exact customer language in quotes.
3. **Mark confidence levels.** Tag data as High/Medium/Low confidence.
4. **Cite sources with URLs and dates.** Include URL and access date for every claim.
5. **Acknowledge gaps.** Explicit "Not available" for missing data.

| Confidence | Definition |
|------------|------------|
| High | Direct from official source, verifiable |
| Medium | Third-party source, multiple signals |
| Low | Single indirect source, inferred |

| `references/workflow.md` | 3-phase step-by-step (extraction → synthesis → structured output) |
| `references/quality.md` | Pre-delivery checklist |
| `references/dimension-schemas.md` | Legacy field definitions (granular) |
| `references/icp-output-template.md` | Full report template with numbered sections |
