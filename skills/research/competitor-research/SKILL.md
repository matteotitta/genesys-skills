# Competitor research

Run a 13-dimension dossier on a B2B SaaS competitor. Output ships with explicit confidence levels, inline source citations, a consolidated Sources & data quality table, and a data-gaps section with follow-up actions. Knowledge type: `competitor-intel` (per `.claude/rules/ontology.md`); maturity: emergent → validated after client review.

## Research substrate

Default substrate: **Exa** (per `.claude/rules/exa-protocol.md`, auto-loaded). Primary tools: `find_similar_links_exa` (structural competitor discovery from a client URL), `web_search_exa` (news, voice, gap discovery), `web_fetch_exa` (clean comparison-page extraction). **Crawl-cost discipline** (`.claude/rules/crawl-cost-discipline.md`): when a dimension needs a competitor's page inventory (Content, SEO/AEO), enumerate pages first with free `mcp__spider__spider_links` (local, no credits), triage to product / pricing / positioning / customer pages, then spend `web_fetch_exa` / Firecrawl only on kept pages — this kills the "fallback to Apify if credits exhausted" failure on large sites. Migration window: prefer the plugin namespace `mcp__plugin_exa_exa__*` once installed; legacy `mcp__exa__*` still mounted as fallback. Worked examples + tool catalog: `.claude/skills/meta-skills/exa/`.

## When to run

Invoke when the user asks for: `competitor analysis for X`, `battlecard research for X`, `competitive landscape for [market]`, `compare X vs Y`, `what's [competitor] doing?`. Do **NOT** invoke for: company qualification (use `/company-context`), product messaging only (use `/product-messaging`), researching the user's own company (use `/company-context`), or single-feature questions (answer directly).

Three run modes — pick by cadence and depth needed:

- **First run** (~90 min) — `/competitor-research [competitor]`. New competitor, no existing dossier. Phases 1–3 (or 1–4 for aggregate).
- **Quick scan** (~30 min, weekly) — `/competitor-research --quick [competitor]` or `/loop 1w`. Refreshes fast-moving data only (news, Clay, G2, internal sources). Updates "Recent changes" header — sections without changes stay untouched.
- **Deep refresh** (~90 min, monthly) — `/competitor-research --refresh [competitor]` or `/loop 1M`. Full 13-dimension cycle with TrustPilot monitor and Phase 4 aggregate (if 2+ competitors refreshed this cycle).

Full cadence + refresh discipline → `references/refresh-protocol.md`. Visual phase map → `references/process-flowchart.md`.

**The Iron Law:** no data point without source. Every claim cites a URL + access date or is marked `[Not available]`. Estimates need explicit confidence + reasoning. "Fast + wrong = useless."

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `competitor name` — exact company/product name (e.g., `Linear`, `Lovable`).
- `website URL` — competitor's site (e.g., `linear.app`).

**Recommended (improve quality):**

- `market category` — disambiguates ambiguous names (e.g., `Bolt` could be ride-share, fintech, or `bolt.new`). See `references/steps/phase-1-confirmation-setup.md` for the disambiguation reference.
- `client context` — current positioning sharpens the comparative angle.
- `specific questions` — focus areas (e.g., "deep dive on their pricing model and outbound motion").
- `research mode` — `single deep dive` (default) or `comparison matrix` (3–6 competitors).

If competitor name is ambiguous (e.g., "Cursor", "Base", "Linear"), confirm with the user before starting. If website URL is missing, ask — don't guess.

## Steps

1. **Confirm scope and disambiguate** → `references/steps/phase-1-confirmation-setup.md`. Verify name + URL, select run mode, lock disambiguation.
2. **Pre-flight optional MCPs** → check Clay, Granola, Google Drive, CRM, Notion availability per `references/refresh-protocol.md` ("Optional internal intel sources"). For each available, queue the corresponding queries; for each missing, skip silently.
3. **Research 13 dimensions** → `references/steps/phase-2-dimension-research.md`. Order: Company → Product → ICP → Pricing → Reviews → Content → Launches → SEO/AEO → Technographics → Openings → GTM → LinkedIn/Social → Paid advertising. Each dimension has tool fallbacks (Ahrefs → Serper → manual; Apify → Firecrawl → manual). Frameworks + scoring → `references/competitor-data-schema.md` ("Core frameworks").
4. **TrustPilot customer monitor** (deep refresh only, customer-facing competitors only) → run inside Step 2.5 per the Phase 2 file. Score top 10–15 customers 🟢/🟡/🔴.
5. **Synthesize and assign confidence** → `references/steps/phase-3-synthesis-gaps.md`. Assign `[VERIFIED]/[INFERRED]/[ESTIMATED]/[UNAVAILABLE]` per claim, write 2–3-paragraph executive summary, document data gaps with follow-up actions.
6. **Aggregate analysis** (only if 2+ competitors researched for same client) → `references/steps/phase-4-aggregate-analysis.md`. Build threat matrix, feature parity table, credibility audit, 3–5 strategic recommendations. Save as `MMYY-aggregate-insights.md` in client's competitors folder.
7. **Apply attribution standard** — inline `(Source: X)` per claim (not the verbose `[VERIFIED: url, date]` block); consolidate full URLs + access dates + confidence in the **Sources & data quality** table at the end of the document. Quality threshold: ≥50% Verified, ≤20% Estimated.
8. **Write to client folder** per output template → `references/output-template.md` ("Inline canonical, v2.7" — 13 dimensions, TrustPilot sub-section, Recent changes header, Sources & data quality table). For matrix mode → `references/matrix-template.md` ("Compact alternative"). Search query patterns per dimension → `references/search-patterns.md`. Common source URL patterns → `references/source-urls.md`.
9. **Self-evaluate against quality gates** → `references/quality-gates.md`. Run completeness, evidence-quality, and guardrail checks before declaring "done".
10. **Push** to Notion (Competitor Research Database) and Google Docs (`client_folder/context/competitor-research/`) per the push targets in frontmatter. For refresh mode, update the existing Notion page rather than creating a duplicate.
11. **Offer iteration prompts** post-delivery → `references/iteration-prompts.md`. If user signals approval (`"great research"`, quick approval), offer to save the output as a reference example under `references/examples/{date}-{competitor-slug}.md`.

## Push

- **Google Docs** → `client_folder/context/competitor-research/` (per-client GDrive folder via `.claude/mcp/gdrive/create-doc-unified.mjs --client {slug}`). Each dossier ships as a branded doc; refresh runs UPDATE the existing doc rather than creating a duplicate.
- **Notion** → `Competitor Research Database` (per-client). Refresh runs UPDATE the existing page (use `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-update-page`) — don't duplicate.

## Integration with other skills

| Direction | Skill | What flows |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Feeds into** | `/positioning` | Competitive alternatives, market context → alternative mapping, differentiation angles |
| **Feeds into** | `/positioning --scenarios` | Competitive landscape → N positioning bets + comparison canvas as a "decisions to make" deck closer |
| **Feeds into** | `/product-messaging` | Competitor weaknesses, positioning gaps → sharpens client messaging, contrast points |
| **Feeds into** | `/sales-enablement` (`/battlecards`, `/sales-deck`) | Full competitor profiles, weaknesses → battlecard content, objection handling |
| **Receives from** | `/company-context` | Client context, market position → comparison baseline |

**Recommended chains:**

- Comprehensive competitive analysis: `company-context → competitor-research → positioning`.
- Decisions-to-make deck: `competitor-research → positioning --scenarios` — append the positioning options + canvas as the deck's "next steps / decisions to make" closing section.
- Battlecard creation: `competitor-research → sales-enablement`.
- Full PMM stack: `icp-behavioural + competitor-research → positioning → product-messaging → sales-enablement`.

## Scheduling (recurring runs)

```
/loop 1w /competitor-research --quick [competitor-name]            # weekly quick scan, set-and-forget
/loop 1M /competitor-research --refresh [competitor-name]          # monthly deep refresh, review-and-approve

/schedule create --name "competitor-[name]-weekly"  --cron "0 9 * * 1" --prompt "/competitor-research --quick [name]"
/schedule create --name "competitor-[name]-monthly" --cron "0 9 1 * *" --prompt "/competitor-research --refresh [name]"
```

For multiple competitors in parallel: `/competitor-research --refresh --all` spawns one subagent per competitor in `references/competitors.json`.

## Sourced patterns — person-level competitor profiling

<!-- Sourced from coreyhaines31/marketingskills/competitor-profiling/SKILL.md (MIT) — accessed 2026-05-17. Imported via /steal I3. -->

Standard `/competitor-research` profiles the *company* (11 dimensions covering positioning, pricing, features, content, GTM, team, funding, etc.). For deeper buyer-side intelligence, add a **person-level layer** that profiles the named decision-maker / champion / founder behind the competitor:

- **Founder / CEO behavioral profile.** Public-content cadence (LinkedIn, X, podcast appearances), preferred narratives, hiring-page tells (what roles they're scaling), customer-conversation patterns (testimonials they highlight, objections they pre-empt). Read for *positioning intent* — founders telegraph strategy in public.
- **Champion persona at the buying account.** Who actually drives the buy at their target accounts? Title patterns, tenure patterns, pain-point language (lifted from their case studies). This is the ICP-buyer side of the equation, not just the ICP-company side.
- **Departure / hiring signals.** Recent senior departures at the competitor = signal of internal tension; recent senior hires = signal of investment lane. Both inform competitive timing.
- **Social-graph cluster.** Who are they engaging with on LinkedIn? Who endorses them publicly? Builds a map of allied / adjacent companies that may be partnership or co-marketing candidates (cross-references with `/co-marketing`).

Use when the standard 11-dimension company profile isn't enough — typically for direct-competitor showdowns or accounts where the champion person is the deal-maker (mid-market and below).
